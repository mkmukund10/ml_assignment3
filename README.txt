# CS-7641 Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction

URL for code
https://github.com/mkmukund10/ml_assignment3

All data is stored under data folder and plots under plot folder.

This project implements the following 2 different clustering techniques k-means and expectation maximization.
- K-Means
- Gaussain mixture model (EM)

This project also implements the following 4 different dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Principal Component Analysis
- Independent Component Analysis
- Random Projection (gaussian)
- Method of choice (Sparse random projection)

** It finaly implements neural network based learner for dimension reduction and clustering for Credit dataset.

## Getting Started

### Installing dependencies and running experiments
The implementation is done through jupyter notebook

Install anaconda for running the notebooks
Install yellowbrick library using pip install yellowbrick

```
You can also individually run the experiments by launching the notebooks using jupyter notebook console
```
For example-

Credit_Clustering_DR.ipynb

```

## Built With
